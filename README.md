## TODO
- Identify if the overshoot during the step is due to non-linearities or implementation differences from MATLAB
- Add in saturation limits to better mimic a physical system
- Rename variables for better documentation
- _Move functions from the main loop into isolated functions_
- Add animations of the pendulum in MATLAB and Python
